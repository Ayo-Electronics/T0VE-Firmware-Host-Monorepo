'''
Host serial interface (physical/protocol layer) for USB Virtual COM Port (VCP) link between Python host software and a USB device.

General philosopy of this class is creating an asynchronous interface to the serial port managed by its own thread.
Data transfer in and out of the serial port is done via queues, for atomic, independent operation of the serial port and the host software.

For simplest, most straight-forward operation, no events are exposed from this class--external facing API will be polling-based.
i.e. view immediate connection status and check/pop from the receive queue with helper functions. 

A utility "recovery" function will help recover stuck downstream devices by sending 0's to the port until a message has been received.
This function should never throw exceptions as long as correct types are passed in.
